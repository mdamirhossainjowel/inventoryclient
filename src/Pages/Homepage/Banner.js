            Why buy from Bikes Alaeze? The Polygon bikes in our online bike shop
            are often half the price of comparable bikes in the market, and that
            is due to our direct to consumer business model. We source
            high-quality bikes from the manufacturer, cut out the middlemen, and
            pass on the savings to you.
